This repository is a collection of notebooks that analyzes thousand datasets on heart-disease in order to try and predict 
if a user has heart disease. The dataset was downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset).

## Problem Definition
_What problem are we trying to solve?_

This data set dates from 1988 and consists of four databases: Cleveland, Hungary, Switzerland, and Long Beach V. It contains 76 attributes, including the predicted attribute, but all published experiments refer to using a subset of 14 of them. The "target" field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient. It is integer valued 0 = no disease and 1 = disease.

The objective of this model creation is to classify if our incoming patients have heart disease based on the same set of tests.
